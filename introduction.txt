## Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Essi Angel. I am currently learning about Git and GitHub as part of a beginner course. I enjoy working on real-life projects and gaining practical skills.

I'm excited to build my version control skills and apply them in various areas including development, documentation, and collaboration. This is the start of my journey!
